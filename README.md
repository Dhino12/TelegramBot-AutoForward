# TelegramBot-AutoForward-Firebase

> [Documentation in Indonesian](https://docs-v1.gitbook.io/autoforward-id/) 🇮🇩

You can use this BOT to gather messages from various Telegram chats (private/public channels, private/public groups, direct chats) and send them to one or multiple chat locations.<br>

Initially, the bot was made just for myself, but I am also very open if this bot is developed by more people and share views on this ✨, sorry due to the lack of free services to deploy I cannot share the bot's running telegram account, but I share how to deploy this bot into hosting until it runs<br>

⚠ Documentation is still a work in progress ⚠ <br>
